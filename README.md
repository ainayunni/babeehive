#### Title: Taska Babeehive
##### Description: This web application is all about the reporting system applied by kindergarten or nursery.


#### The objective of the enhancement are to: 
* Protect our website from being attacked by the attackers
* Ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our website
* Avoid data breach which can result in lawsuits and heavy fines

#### Web Application Security Enhancement which includes:

**i. Input Validation** 
* The input elements that are being validated are email and name at the client side. 

**ii. Authentication**
* Hashed password: by default, Laravel provides secure Bcrypt hashing for storing the user passwords

**iii. Authorization**
* Role-based system: There are 3 roles for this system which are admin, teacher and parents. And each role will have a different view on the dashboard, which their privilege is limited to the task that they can do. 
* Encrypted cookie: As the cookie is unsecure, the cookie will be encrypted on the web client and will be compared to the server-side to check the authentication to avoid from being tempered or stolen. 
* Log out function: The user can log out with a single click
* Enforce idle session time out: After 20 minutes being idle, the system will auto out log out and the user need to log in back into the system 

**iv. XSS and CSRF Prevention**
* Sanitize input by using "curly" braces {{ }} which display data passed to the Blade views by wrapping the variable in it. This is to prevent XSS attacks for from the input
* CSRF token: Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session that the application manages to check that the authenticated user is actually making requests to the application or not. HTML form will include a hidden CSRF token field in the form so that the CSRF protection middleware can validate the request.

**v. Database Security Principles** 
* Receive input as string instead of SQL queries as the input

**vi. File Security Principles**
* Disable directory listing: disable the web servers list the content of a directory from the unauthorized user by creating an empty index file _index.php_
